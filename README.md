* Add Product Form

** See the live site at https://mejiaj84.github.io/Fall-2021-CPW203-FormWithClass-Add-Product/

This project will allow me to get more practice using more 
- TypeScript 
- Form validation 
- Introduce custom classes.

The project will also use CSS to make a decent looking web page that is responsive to screen size.
